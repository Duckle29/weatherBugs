This project will use two ESP8266s as an indoor temp and humidity sensor and gate-way, and an out-door
battery-powered temp/hum sensor, sending data via ESP-NOW.

The project is not done yet, but here's the todo:

[x] Get communication with wunderground PWS working
[x] Get ESP-now communication between station and bugs
[ ] Get mode-switching between ESP-now station and wifi-connected station working (haven't tested it)
[ ] Get SHT31 sensor implemented (waiting for the sensor)
